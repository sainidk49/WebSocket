# By using web-socket protocol, we can establish a persistent connection between the client and server. This allows for real-time communication.

 => in the first time , we need to establish a connection between the client and server. This is done by sending a request. And first request is HTTP,

 # Diffirence between HTTP and Web-socket

 => HTTP
 - HTTP is a request-response protocol. It is a stateless protoco.
 - HTTP is used for request-response communication between client and server.
 - Unidirectional
 - HTTP is a connectionless protocol. It means that each request is independent of the other requests.
 - Half-duplex

 => Web socket
 - Web socket is a stateful protocol.
 - Web socket is a bi-directional, full-duplex communication protocol.
 - Web socket is a connection-oriented protocol. It means that the connection is established before the communication starts.

 - Web socket is used for real-time communication between client and server.
